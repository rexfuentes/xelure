Code Cleanup:

Ensure all your scripts are well-commented, explaining the purpose of each major step or function.
Remove any redundant or unused code to make the scripts as concise as possible.
Documentation Structure:

Title Page: Project name, your name, date, and contact information.
Table of Contents: Easy navigation to different sections.
Introduction: Brief overview of the project, objectives, and scope.
Methodology: Detailed explanation of the approach, including choice of tools, languages, libraries, and algorithms.
Code Explanation: Walkthrough of the code. For this, you can:
	Embed code snippets in your Google Doc, using the "Insert > Code" formatting option for better readability.
	Explain what each script does and how they interact with each other.
	Describe the purpose of each SQL query.
Findings: Summary of results, data insights, or what the code accomplishes.
Challenges and Solutions: Any issues faced and how you resolved them.
Conclusion: Wrap up the document, reiterating the success and results of the project.
Appendices: Full code listings, additional data, or extended explanations.

Proposal for Future Enhancements:
	Outline potential improvements, features, or scalability options.
	Discuss how the project can evolve with additional data, tools, or under different constraints.

Exporting Code from Jupyter:
	Use the "File > Download as" option in Jupyter Notebook to export your code as a .py file or a .pdf document if you want to preserve the output visualizations.
	Clean up the exported files to ensure they are readable and well-formatted.

Sharing the Documentation:
	Compile your documentation and code into a Google Doc or a PDF file.
	Use a professional layout with proper headings, subheadings, and bullet points.
	Include visual aids like flowcharts, diagrams, or screenshots where helpful.

Review:
	Proofread your documentation for spelling, grammar, and clarity.
	Verify that all code snippets are accurate and match what is in the actual scripts.
	Ensure the flow of the document is logical and that technical terms are explained or defined.

Sharing the Deliverables:
	If sharing via Google Docs, make sure your sharing settings are correct, and that you provide access to the intended recipients.
	Alternatively, package your documentation and code files into a zip archive and share them via email or a file-sharing service.
	This structure not only provides a comprehensive view of your work but also demonstrates professionalism and attention to detail, which can be crucial for client presentations, academic submissions, or portfolio displays.
